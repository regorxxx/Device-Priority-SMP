Automate foobar2000's output selection:
	- Device 1 is connected, select it as output.
	- Otherwise, fall back to Device 2 instead of setting 
	"nothing" as output.
	- Otherwise, fall back to Device 3.
	...

As noted, it may be used to automatically switch to headphones or 
wireless outputs as soon as they are connected / switched on, falling
back to the default output when they are not.
	
Usage:
	- Export first the device list with all the desired devices connected
	to use them at a later point (even if the devices are not connected).
	- 'Set Device X\' menus will only show either currently connected 
	devices or the ones from the exported list.
	- In other words, you can only assign devices to the priority list if
	they are available on the menus. 
	- A disconnected device, not available on the exported list, will be
	shown as \'Not connected device\', with its name at top.
